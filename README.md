# DSA-P1
 1.Write a Python program to manage the borrowing records of books in a library.Implement
the following functionalities:
• Compute the average number of books borrowed by all library members.
• Find the book with the highest and lowest number of borrowings in the library.
• Count the number of members who have not borrowed any books
(denoted by a borrow count of 0).
• Display the most frequently borrowed book (i.e., the mode of borrow counts).
